# DOTFILES
My dotfiles intended to be used on OSX and Debian / Fedora based Linux distros

## About
This is a single place to hold my mostly cobbled together scripts, and bash customizations built over the years.

Also included will be installation scripts to quickly set up a new development machine or to configure and set up my home server.
